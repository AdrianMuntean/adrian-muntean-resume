 1. Register yourself on npmjs.com
 2. Add a user to you npm cli tool with "npm adduser"
 3. Making your project ready for publishing. Add these following lines to the package.json file of your cli app:
	"bin": {
		"<your package name>": "./index.js"
	}
 4. Publish the package: "npm publish --access=public"
 5. Upon upgrading increase the proper semantic version: "npm version patch", "npm version minor" or "npm version major". After that just "npm publish"
